Hi Dr. Lyu,

First of all, I apologize for the overdue email. I'm a compulsive procrastinator and some of the subject matters here have been difficult. I'm not sure how to relate some of my experiences in a way that others can understand. But I will attempt to make a case for reasonable doubt regarding the validity of my prior diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder. 

This involves two main assertions. The first assertion is that covert surveillance and organized/coordinated harassment tactics has historically been carried out and continues to be carried out in various evolving forms against vulnerable people by entities with the necessary means and motives. The second assertion is that there is a substantial likelihood that I myself have been subject to such tactics, and that my schizophrenic symptomatology was an induced facade intended by my covert adversaries to obfuscate the facts, mislead observers, and disguise the nature and extent of their activities.

### Recent Allegations of Covert Abuse:

Please refer to this document (apparently submitted by an anonymous individual) that I found on the website of United Nations Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights while researching the topic in 2023: https://web.archive.org/web/20220317202641/https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Torture/Call/Individuals/Harrassmenttechniques.pdf

I believe that I've encountered all of the aforementioned techniques in some form over the past years, except for number 7 (sound projector device) and 10 (sleep deprivation). I may have been subject to technique number 8 (direct energy weapon, especially relating to a sudden, intense, and unprecedented headache on the morning that the family was scheduled to meet with the family doctor to discuss my concerns regarding Mr. Su, which spooked me enough to call for an ambulance, eventually leading to my hospitalization on the doctor's suspicion that I had been experiencing sensory hallucinations) and 13 (blackbag job, though this was actually done by Mr. Su back in 2010, seemingly prior to outsider involvement, and I believe he was simply trying to get back at me for being persistently passive aggressive toward him).

- Judging from videos like this one, it seems that many or most self-described TIs are experiencing psychogenic mental disorders. However, this isn't mutually exclusive with being targeted for organized harassment.

- The participants might be members of preexisting clandestine and semi-clandestine networks, including organized crime groups, community policing organizations, and private security contractors with intelligence agency ties, operating with different motives and agendas, as examined through techniques like social network analysis in the field of criminology (which I took some courses in as part of my forensic psychology program).

- In some cases, like the harassment of the gay man, it's possible that the participants in the harassment were motivated by personal prejudices against individuals they perceive as transgressors of societal norms, and perhaps acted of their accord without explicit instructions from above. That said, such activities seem to be disproportionately directed against 'safe targets', marginalized and vulnerable individuals (including paranoid schizophrenics. more on that later) lacking the social and financial resources to meaningfully resist in ways that present risks to the perpetrators and their operations. In addition, these casual harassment routines may serve purposes beyond petty revenge, such as to provide regular opportunities to learn and practice industry-related skills and techniques, and to establish a smoke screen that helps to mask/obfuscate/camouflage their more sensitive operations. Consider how peculiar it would seem to onlookers if reports of these disruptive encounters happen to disproportionately come from political activists, whistle blowers, people who pissed off the wrong people, and classified research subjects (as in MKULTRA). The organizers and backers of these kinds of criminal activities therefore have an incentive to encourage, tacitly support, or at least overlook them, in order to maintain a big enough haystack in which to hide their needles. But this is just one possible angle from which to interpret the allegations of organized surveillance and harassment.

However, even non-schizophrenic individuals could be made to exhibit symptoms of extreme paranoia through induced hyper-vigilance when subject to sustained covert harassment.

- Side note: on Feb 27th, the day after I typed out this part, two unfamiliar Caucasian men looking to be around 30 years of age showed up to the supermarket where I have been work as a deli clerk for the past several years, at around 12:25pm. One of the men sported a peculiar Italian accent intermixed with a bit of stereotypical Russian intonations. When I first saw them, one of the men, I think the one with the accent, was holding out a handset with his arm bent at an awkward angle, and appeared to be talking to the person on the other end, who was on speaker. I suspect that these two persons are affiliated with the entity(s) that's been spying on me and repressing me, and that they intended to get my attention through subtle cues. The interaction didn't appear hostile, and the goal of this particular visit isn't apparent to me, though one possibility is that they expected that I'd make a note of this incident, and perhaps that I'd pass it on. Whatever the case, I imagine that they're likely to make their presence known to people they perceive as potential adversaries or assets. So please be mindful of that, and don't be alarmed, as the ones I've encountered seem to mostly operate within Canadian law.

- I'm skeptical about some of his speculations. For example he ascribed political motives to him being targeted, claiming that he was pressured to desist from supporting Indigenous political activism, which would implicate the Canadian government or perhaps a oil and gas company in the crimes against him. However, another potential explanation is that his minders/harassers were worried that his Youtube project might attract enough public attention to endanger the secrecy of their operation targeting him, so they pressured him into giving up on that plan. The motive here isn't as clear cut as it might seem, though I do find it more likely than not that the people targeting him had government ties, however indirect and informal, and that politics was a significant motive, but was pursued through policy loopholes, downplayed with euphemisms, and disguised with pretexts. Perhaps because to do otherwise would sharply contradict Canada's global image and branding as a liberal democracy, to an extent that would be too difficult for its officials to excuse. Keep in mind however that these are highly circumstantial and unverified allegations from a single pseudonymous source. And, of course, it's never okay to harass sentient beings with or without political motives.

- A proven case of covert ops targeting Toronto-based Citizen Labs. NSO Group, an Israeli cyber-intelligence firm that sells advanced spyware to governments around the world for intended use against criminals and terrorists, paid Black Cube, a private intelligence agency, to mount a covert smear campaign against journalists and family members of murdered political dissidents that have been critical of its business practices. Black Cubes is known to employing ex-professional spies from intelligence agencies like the Mossad, though it should be noted that they command a steep asking price for their services, as not every private spying firm is so selective in its recruitment process. Most cases of organized harassment are carried out through more economical options.

### Personal Experiences:
- In my case, I believe that I have been subject to continuous cyber (meaning on social media and on my networked computing devices) and physical (meaning with regards to my physical person and activities) surveillance and active psychological harassment by unidentified entities from at least 2015 onwards. Over the past few years I've increasingly come to suspect that the surveillance may have began even earlier, possibly around 2011, based on a number of odd interactions relating to Mr. Su at the time, and I suspect that he had reached out to or had been contacted by outside parties about certain legal issues, such as my criminal activities and the ongoing domestic conflict between me and him, though it appears that little to no action was taken at that point besides cyber and possibly physical surveillance. In one very notable encounter, he said "反震我是不怕警察 (well *I'm* not afraid of the police)" as we passed each other on the lower floor staircase. In another notable instance, suspecting that he had installed a keylogger on my phone (a Nokia E5, running on the Symbian S60 OS commonly found on budget smartphones around the world), I typed out the word "die" on my phone homescreen after coming home from school while he was still at work, thinking I might get some kind of reaction from him. After coming home that night he was constantly sniffling, speaking very few words to mother, and appeared unusually down. This was possibly a case of the frequency illusion, or it could've been a coincidence involving him being genuinely upset about something else, though in light of subsequent developments, the most paranoid explanation now seems the most probable, namely that he was faking an emotional reaction in response to a fake death threat that he should've had no way of knowing. Since he works as a computer programmer, he presumably had the technical skills to procure and install a keylogginger on a smartphone. If I recall, my mother had required me at the time to turn in my phone every night in an attempt to curb my smartphone usage, so he would've had physical access to it. However, it's also possible that an outside entity was spying on me, which has a different set of legal and ethical implications.
- The notable events of 2015 are outlined in the report from that time.
- From late 2015 to late 2018, surveillance and harassment appeared to intensify, though they remained hidden from me for the most part, at least until a week or two prior to the start of my studies at Wilfrid Laurier University, Brantford campus. It was at that point that they chose to more or less reveal that they'd hacked my computer, apparently to send a veiled and ambiguous warning. This was also accompanied by a number of unusually suggestive dialogues from Mr. Su. However, I still could not empirically prove that I was under surveillance, because instead of overtly stating in words or writing that they were spying on me, it seems they merely hinted this through a number of improbable and contrived coincidences, in the form of computer glitches and technical issues.
- I strongly suspect that I was also under targeted surveillance by Chinese intelligence entities during a trip to mainland China with my grandparents early in 2018. As a side note, a relative from each side of my family has reported receiving harassment and threats by unidentified entities, one in 2016, and another in 2019. In the case of the first relative, the harassment appears to have occurred shortly after my hospitalization at the end of 2015, and I strongly suspect that the timing was an intentional coincidence. The relative apparently told his parent that a woman identifying herself as an American intelligence asset had visited his residence and warned him that his online activities were harmful to US national interests, spooking him and eventually causing him to move back in with his parents. In the case of the second relative, who reached out to me in November or December 2018, seemingly out of the blue to inquire about how I was doing, it was I who implied the involvement of the CIA through a message in Wechat, a Chinese messaging app. It's unclear whether they had been targeted by US intelligence entities, or by a different party posing as them.
- From late 2018 to now, there have been numerous suspicious incidents. Since these seem to have occurred within the context of a complex series of socio-political developments that seem to extend far beyond my extremely limited field of perception and knowledge, I can't make much sense of them and I will refrain from delving into them here. But based on my observations, it seems that these developments have received considerable attention from Canadian and US intelligence agencies, and also that a large number of content creators I follow online, mostly consisting of podcasters, Youtubers, and bloggers, have been approached, co-opted, and possibly pressured by these entities and/or their affiliates. This also appears to be the case with some of my neighbors and coworkers.
- I've disclosed some of these experiences to Dr. Carlos Yu, my family doctor at the Ajax Family Practice from 2017 onward. I'm not sure whether he believes me, though during a group meeting with me and my mother in 2018, he appeared to be in agreement when she complained to him about me being stuck in my way of thinking. I had stopped visiting him on a regular basis, but In the months after the scandal over at WLU Brantford, it seemed that he and other staff members at the clinic became uneasy around me whenever I showed up to appointments. I hadn't told him about exactly what happened, but the rumors had apparently spread to Ajax. One time I showed up twice within a single month because I was accompanying my grandfather to his checkup. He noticed me sitting in his office while walking past and briefly stopped to ask "look, what do you want?" with an undisguised tone of exasperation, as if I had an ulterior motive for coming by. I think it was because of my guarded expression upon seeing him that day. On one of my latter visits in 2019 or 2020, after the negative publicity had mostly died down, I overheard from the receptionists that the clinic's network or health information system had gone offline that morning. For some reason I suspected foul play, though this could easily have been a natural coincidence.
- My mother signed me up for a private psychological counseling service in early 2019. My counselor was previously working in academia as a lecturer, and was completing his residency at this facility. I had roughly a dozen sessions with him in total. During one of the earlier sessions I touched on the subject of my sexuality. He didn't react in a visible way to the information (aside from possibly twirling a foot in a whimsical fashion while sitting cross-legged as, I suppose, a casual gibe, as he had done on several occasions). At the start of the next session, I noticed that one of the office windows was open (it's normally closed during appointments), and he casually asked about what I told him the last time regarding my sexuality, and I answered to the affirmative. A moment later, I heard someone coughing from the area indicated in the image below. This appeared to have been a coordinated act, and it seems unlikely that the person would be able to clearly hear our conversation from that distance. And it's furthermore illegal for healthcare practitioners to divulge their client's personal information without their informed consent. Therefore, I think most likely scenario here is that my counselor had been approached and co-opted by an agent at some earlier point, and since the agent presumably had legal approval to spy on me, this stunt might be legally defensible, and in any case it's practically impossible for me to prove in court, not that I care to do so. ![[Pasted image 20240228115553.jpg]]
- During one of my virtual meetings with someone at Ontario Shores in 2023, I discussed a minor detail of little importance, relating to a curious coincidence I witnessed in 2017. A few seconds later, my phone rang and I showed what appeared to be an incoming spam call to the person I was talking to on camera. She asked if that was related to what I was talking about and I said perhaps it is. My interpretation is that the call was intended as a warning of sorts.

* Criminal and spy networks with interlocking ties, colloquially referred to as the "criminal underworld", roughly analogous to the submerged portion of an iceberg
* Historical techniques/protocols for discrediting, isolating, silencing, and/or incapacitating people in covert and deniable ways, for reasons ranging from petty revenge to counterintelligence to social control, prompted by strong legal and political disincentives against committing outright murder, that are largely enforced by functioning oversight and law enforcement bodies, unlike in many other places around the world

* Advancements in digital and surveillance technologies, Foucault's notion of biopower, panopticism, chilling effect
* Geopolitical competition, novel forms of warfare (including cyber-, information-, neuro-) driving the research and development of weaponized technologies, many/most of which are officially classified under national security legislation, which may require testing on human subjects, as had been performed as part of the clandestine, illegal, and ethically questionable MKULTRA research program
* 9/11, global war on terrorism, expansion of digital and physical surveillance infrastructure and capabilities, outsourcing/delegation of domestic intelligence works (euphemistically-speaking) to private security subcontractors with loose oversight
* Socioeconomic trends, expanding wealth disparity since the 1980s, growing social unrest due to inter-class conflict
	* https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/
* Proliferation of social media and its displacement of traditional media led the weakening of elite influence over popular opinion (notably through propaganda), contributing to political chaos and instability at the hands of radical groups like Black Identity Extremists, Marxists, Anonymous, and Wikileaks, and the state security apparatus attempting to avert a total breakdown of political order by utilizing more coercive methods to maintain social order/control
* Local organizations like Neighborhood Watch and Infraguard, which perform legitimate community policing functions (ie. keeping tabs on thieves, street gangs, child sexual predators, and other criminals), but can also double as human intelligence-gathering (HUMINT) networks, while providing a sanitized public-facing image and PR cover (centered around community safety) for politically unsavory aspects of domestic espionage activities against targeted persons; the extent of their complicity in alleged organized harassment cases is presently unclear

Controlling Popular Perception:

- What accounts for lack of popular awareness and acceptance? Must seek to explain.
- Who, what/how, where, when, why
- What's the logic behind Zersetzung-like tactics? Exploiting paranoid schizophrenia both as an epidemiological phenomenon, and as a psychological phenomenon by reproducing and weaponizing its stress-inducing symptoms.
* The scientifically established, widely believed, and rather convenient existence of mental health disorders like schizophrenia, that stigmatize and discredit people believed to be so afflicted, and which nefarious actors can exploit to camouflage organized harassment activities against said people
* Explaining the lack of media coverage. Journalistic standards for gathering and publishing allegations of wrongdoing, which these covert techniques are designed to counter. Judicial standards for criminal indictment are even stricter.
* Unusually high prevalence rates of organized harassment reporting in US and Canada might not necessarily reflect actual prevalence rate, but anything from cultural extroversion of North Americans to survivorship bias (people in repressive systems face censorship and reprisal for reporting), per the saying, "the absence of evidence doesn't prove absence"
* Secrecy, clandestine programs, classified. Suppression of information. Sowing doubt. Systematic use of disinformation tactics. Private spooks/mercenaries employed by "private security subcontractors", which are employed and theoretically overseen by state intelligence agencies. Recruited personnel may have criminal backgrounds, for example the use of professional scammers for sowing disinformation on online websites and forums as to help obfuscate clandestine activities, ideally resulting in public disbelief, but otherwise masking their true nature and extent. Covert psychological disruption and coercion tactics (including forms of physical intimidation) may be used to disrupt and deter targets' efforts at disclosure, especially in contexts with potential legal risks for the perpetrators and their employers.
